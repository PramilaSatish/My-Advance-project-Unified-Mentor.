## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #2E86AB (RGB), a deep blue associated with trust and connection, inspired by team colors but aiming for uniqueness. This is a more vibrant choice than the background, without being overly saturated.
- Background color: #D4E6F1 (RGB), a light, desaturated blue provides a clean, calming backdrop that harmonizes with the primary color.
- Accent color: #A93226 (RGB), a deep red to contrast for calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short text with its modern and techy feel; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text where longer readability is needed.
- Use clean and modern icons representing different sports activities. Ensure they are easily recognizable and consistent throughout the app.
- Implement a grid-based layout to ensure consistency and responsiveness across different devices. Prioritize easy navigation and clear visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. Use animations to indicate loading states or provide feedback on user interactions.
